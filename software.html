        <h2>Software</h4>
        <p>I'm a full stack developer with a focus on back end Java.</p>

        <h4>Technologies and processes</h4>
        <p>I've been part of traditional, Scrum and Agile methodologies. I've used Java for 5 years, JavaScript for 3 years and have non-professional experience with Groovy, Scala, C, Python. I enjoy learning about esoteric languages and language design in general and have a strong preference for using functional languages. I've used associated technologies and standards such as Spring, Hibernate, ActiveMQ, Apache Servers, Jetty, SOAP, XML, JSON, Node, AngularJS, React, MongoDB, MySQL, CSS, HTML, JUnit, Mocha, Jasmine, Grunt, jQuery, Backbone. I enjoy pair programming, mob coding and think code review is vital. I think code should be easy to read, understand and modify.</p>
        <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p>I've worked 
            <ul>
                <li>on greenfield front end Javascript on an embedded STB system, similar to netflix and chromecast</li>
                <li>on legacy back end Java, integrating 3rd party webservices to core system and bug fixing</li>
                <li>as a consultant, implementing reconcilliation systems for international financial institute, using ActiveMQ, Spring, Hibernate and Salesforce integrations to sync data safely</li>
                <li>to help create and run graduate program to give graduates the needed professional skills and get them ready for clients</li>
                <li>on front end admin console for security admins using React</li>
                <li>on greenfield command line shell for admins using automatic code generation, as schema was instance specific</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I have a keen interest in 'soft skills' in engineering such as interpersonal skills, teamwork, understanding motivation and conflict resolution. I've given talks on this subject locally in the hopes that other engineers will see the value and consider this side of engineering.</p>
